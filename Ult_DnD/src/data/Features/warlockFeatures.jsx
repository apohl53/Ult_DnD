If an invocation has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn that invocation. For example, if an invocation requires you to be a level 5+ Warlock, you can select the invocation once you reach Warlock level 5. Replacing and Gaining Invocations. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your invocations with another one for which you qualify.

      "Through occult ceremony, you have formed a pact with a mysterious entity to gain magical powers. The entity is a voice in the shadows—its identity unclear—but its boon to you is concrete: the ability to cast spells. Cantrips. You know two Warlock cantrips of your choice. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Warlock cantrip of your choice. When you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you learn another Warlock cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Warlock Features table. Spell Slots. The Warlock Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock spells of levels 1-5. The table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a Short or Long Rest. For example, when you're a level 5 Warlock, you have two level 3 spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell Witch Bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a level 3 spell. Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Warlock spells. The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Warlock Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Warlock spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new Warlock spell, which can be of levels 1-3. If another Warlock feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Warlock spells for you. Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Warlock spell of an eligible level. Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is the spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells.Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells.",

    Eldritch Thieves' Tools. As a bonus action, you can magically create a special set of thieves' tools in your hand. These tools' appearance reflects the nature of your patron. For instance, they might look fleshy and organic if your patron is an aberration, or take the form of un- fathomably complex clockwork devices if your patron is a creature of cryptic order. Regardless of their appearance, they function like nor- mal thieves' tools, while also allowing you to use them as a spellcasting focus. While using them to disarm a trap or open a lock, you can use Charisma instead of Dexterity for the ability checks. The tools disappear if you create them again or if they're more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or longer.`,

    In addition, if you successfully end a spell on a creature, you can steal its effects for yourself. After the spell ends on the creature, you can choose to have it immediately take effect on you for the remainder of its duration. This stolen spell targets only you, even if it can normally target more creatures, and if it requires concentration, you must concentrate to maintain it.
