When you reach certain levels in this class, you learn additional runes, as shown in the Runes Known table. See Info Page for Table.
    
    Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a number of objects equal to the number of runes you know, and you inscribe a different rune onto each of the objects. To be eligible, an object must be a weapon, a suit of armor, a shield, a piece of jewelry, or something else you can wear or hold in a hand. Your rune remains on an object until you finish a long rest, and an object can bear only one of your runes at a time.

    The following runes are available to you when you learn a rune. If a rune has a level requirement, you must be at least that level in this class to learn the rune. If a rune requires a saving throw, your Rune Magic save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.

    Cloud Rune. This rune emulates the deceptive magic used by some cloud giants. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks and Charisma (Deception) checks.

    In addition, when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune and choose a different creature within 30 feet of you, other than the attacker. The chosen creature becomes the target of the attack, using the same roll. This magic can transfer the attack's effects regardless of the attack's range. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

    Fire Rune. This rune's magic channels the masterful craftsmanship of great smiths. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool.

    In addition, when you hit a creature with an attack using a weapon, you can invoke the rune to summon fiery shackles: the target takes an extra 2d6 fire damage, and it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained for 1 minute. While restrained by the shackles, the target takes 2d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, banishing the shackles on a success. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

    Frost Rune. This rune's magic evokes the might of those who survive in the wintry wilderness, such as frost giants. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks and Charisma (Intimidation) checks.

    In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action to increase your sturdiness. For 10 minutes, you gain a +2 bonus to all ability checks and saving throws that use Strength or Constitution. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

    Stone Rune. This rune's magic channels the judiciousness associated with stone giants. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks, and you have darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

    In addition, when a creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune and force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the creature is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the creature has a speed of 0 and is incapacitated, descending into a dreamy stupor. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

    Hill Rune (7th Level or Higher). This rune's magic bestows a resilience reminiscent of a hill giant. While wearing or carrying an object that bears this rune, you have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance against poison damage.

    In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action, gaining resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for 1 minute. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

    Storm Rune (7th Level or Higher). Using this rune, you can glimpse the future like a storm giant seer. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks, and you can't be surprised as long as you aren't incapacitated.

    In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action to enter a prophetic state for 1 minute or until you're incapacitated. Until the state ends, when you or another creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to cause the roll to have advantage or disadvantage. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

    description: `Starting at 3rd level, you are remarkably light on your feet and capable of counterbalancing even some of the most awkward of equipment. Lances have the versatile property for you while you're not mounted, dealing 1d8 piercing damage on a hit when held with one hand and 1d12 piercing damage when wielded with two. When you use your Launch feature and immediately hit with a melee attack using a lance, it counts as if you're wielding it with two hands.

    If you hit a creature within 5 feet of you using a lance, you can immediately move up to 5 feet away from it, without provoking an opportunity attack from the target. You must be standing and have movement remaining in order to move in this way.`,

    description: `Also at 3rd level, you learn to identify common birds by their calls, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks when interacting with any beast that has an innate flying speed. In addition, you gain the ability to cast the animal messenger spell, but only as a ritual and only targeting a beast that has an innate flying speed.`,

    description: `Starting at 7th level, wearing armor doesn't impose disadvantage on your Dexterity (Stealth) checks. In addition, whenever you make a Dexterity saving throw, you can use your Launch feature as a reaction. When you do so, you take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.`,

    name: "Eagle Eye",
    description: `Beginning at 10th level, your attack made immediately after or during your Launch scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. If you hit a flying creature with this attack, it must also make a Strength saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier). On a failed save, its speed is reduced to 0 feet until the start of its next turn.

    In addition, you gain proficiency in the Perception skill if you don't already have it, and your proficiency bonus is doubled for any Wisdom (Perception) check you make that relies on sight.`,

    description: `Starting at 18th level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack immediately after or during your Launch, it must also succeed on a Strength saving throw (save DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone.

    In addition, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits when you use your Launch feature. When you do, your leap can total a maximum of 90 feet, instead of 30, and you don't suffer any damage from falling until you land again. Once you use this feature, you shouldn't do so again before you finish a short or long rest. Each time you do, you suffer one level of exhaustion. You can't use this feature in this way if you're suffering from two or more levels of exhaustion.`,
