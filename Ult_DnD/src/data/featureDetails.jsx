**Damage Resistance**  
You have Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.

**Rage Damage**

**Strength Advantage**  
You have Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

**No Concentration or Spells**  
You can't maintain Concentration, and you can't cast spells.

**Duration**  
The Rage lasts until the end of your next turn, and it ends early if you don Heavy armor or have the Incapacitated condition. If your Rage is still active on your next turn, you can extend the Rage for another round by doing one of the following:

- Make an attack roll against an enemy  
- Force an enemy to make a saving throw  
- Take a Bonus Action to extend your Rage
